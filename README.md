# Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing crash events related to motor vehicle collisions in New York City. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that can help improve road safety and decision-making processes.

## Project Overview

To carry out this analysis, a **Dimensional Model** was developed, incorporating both **Fact** and **Dimension** tables. These tables were constructed using data from NYC motor vehicle collision records.

### Key Steps Involved:
1. **Dimensional Modeling**:
   - Fact and Dimension tables were designed to organize the data effectively.
   
2. **Data Profiling with Alteryx**:
   - Alteryx was used to profile the data and identify areas that required cleaning and correction.
   
3. **Data Cleaning and Integration with Talend**:
   - Talend was employed to implement the necessary corrections and merge data from multiple sources into cohesive tables.
   
4. **Business Intelligence Reporting**:
   - The final phase of the project involved generating insightful reports and dashboards using Business Intelligence (BI) tools.
   
## Tableau Dashboard

The results of the analysis, including visualizations and key insights, are showcased in an interactive Tableau dashboard. You can view the final reports and dashboards here:
