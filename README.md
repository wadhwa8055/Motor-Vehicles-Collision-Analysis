# NYC_MotorVehicle_Collision_Analysis


This project focuses on conducting data analysis on crash events related to NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions.

To begin with, we have developed a Dimensional Model that encompasses both Fact and Dimension tables. These tables have been constructed using our data source. In order to identify areas requiring data cleaning and correction, I employed Alteryx for Data Profiling. Furthermore, Talend was utilized to implement the necessary modifications and merge data from various sources into one or multiple tables.

The provided link showcases the final stage of my project, which involved generating reports and dashboards using Business Intelligence (BI) tools:
